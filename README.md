# Notes-for-Deep-Learning
Notes for deep learning online course, given by Andrew Ng on: [Mooc.study.163](https://mooc.study.163.com/smartSpec/detail/1001319001.htm).  

This online course consists of 5 parts in total, some basic knowledge about neural network is introduced in the first few parts. While in the part4 and part5, CNN and RNN are explained in detail respectively.  

My notes here mainly covers `CNN` and `RNN`. As you can see on the website, both part4 and part5 consist of 4 `weeks`. So, my notes which are `continually updating`, will be uploaded every 'week'.

## Tip:
1.The notes are suitable for beginners in DL, and you can take it as a reference after attending the online course. 

2.Due to my limited knowledge, some opinions in the notes may be somehow subjective or incorrect, so you should hold a critical attitude towards it.
