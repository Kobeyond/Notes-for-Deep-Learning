# Notes-for-Deep-Learning
Notes for deep learning online course, given by Andrew Ng on https://mooc.study.163.com/smartSpec/detail/1001319001.htm.

This online course consists of 5 parts in total, some basic knowledge about neural network is introduced in the first few parts. While in the part4 and part5, CNN and RNN are explained in detail respectively. 

My notes here mainly covers CNN and RNN. As you can see on the website, both part4 and part5 consists of 4 'weeks'. So, my notes are uploaded every 'week', and continually updating.

# Tip:
1.The notes are suitable for beginners in DL, and you can take it as reference after attending the online course.

2.Due to my limited knowledge, some opinions in the notes may be somehow subjective or incorrect, so you should hold a critical attitude toward it.
